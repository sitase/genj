                    Asking for a line is a rather tricky thing.
                    We have to construct an Info object that specifies
                    the desired properties for the line.
                    First, we have to say which kind of line we want. The
                    possibilities are: SourceDataLine (for playback), Clip
                    (for repeated playback)   and TargetDataLine (for
                    recording).
                    Here, we want to do normal playback, so we ask for
                    a SourceDataLine.
                    Then, we have to pass an AudioFormat object, so that
                    the Line knows which format the data passed to it
                    will have.
                    Furthermore, we can give Java Sound a hint about how
                    big the internal buffer for the line should be. This
                    isn't used here, signaling that we
                    don't care about the exact size. Java Sound will use
                    some default value for the buffer size.
